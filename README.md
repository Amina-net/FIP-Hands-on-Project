# FIP FINAL HANDS ON PROJECT

This repository contains two simple machine learning projects demonstrating the use of Supervised and Unsupervised Learning techniques using Python and Scikit-learn.


Project 1: Supervised Learning – Outcome Prediction

Focus Area:
Supervised Learning

Objective:
Predict outcomes using labeled data.

Activity:
- Found a labeled dataset online.
- Built a simple predictive model using Scikit-learn.
- Evaluated and displayed predictions in a Jupyter Notebook.

Deliverable
- `SupervisedLearning.ipynb`: Contains the dataset loading, model creation, training, and prediction.




Project 2: Unsupervised Learning – Clustering

Focus Area:
Unsupervised Learning

Objective:
Find patterns in unlabeled data.

Activity:
- Found an unlabeled dataset online.
- Applied a clustering algorithm (K-means) using Scikit-learn.
- Visualized the clusters in a Jupyter Notebook.

Deliverable
- `UnsupervisedLearning.ipynb`: Contains data preprocessing, clustering logic, and visualization of clusters.
